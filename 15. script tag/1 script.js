//The <script> tag is used in HTML to include JavaScript code in a webpage. 
//There are two ways of using it:


/*
//1.Inline: You can write JavaScript code directly inside the <script> tag like this:
<script>
    // JavaScript code goes here
</script>
*/



/*
//2.External: You can use the src attribute of the <script> tag to reference an external JavaScript file like this:

<script src="path/to/your/script.js"></script>
