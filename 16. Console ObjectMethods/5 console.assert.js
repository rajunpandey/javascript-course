//The console.assert() method is used to assert a condition. If the condition is true, nothing happens. If the condition is false, the error message is printed to the console.

let x = 5;
console.assert(x == 5, "Error: x is not equal to 5"); // Output: no output
console.assert(x == 6, "Error: x is not equal to 6"); // Output: Assertion failed: Error: x is not equal to 6
