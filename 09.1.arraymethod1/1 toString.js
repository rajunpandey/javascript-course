//Array methods are functions that are called on an array. They can be used to perform operations on the elements of an array

//The toString() method converts an array to a string of comma-separated values. For example, 

let fruits = ["Apple", "Orange", "Banana"];
console.log(fruits.toString()); 
console.log(typeof fruits.toString());
