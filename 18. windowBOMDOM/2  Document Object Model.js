/*
//1.The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. 
//It creates a tree-like representation of the document, which allows developers to interact with it and modify its content and structure.
//In JavaScript, the DOM is represented by the document object. You can access the document object by typing document in the browser console.

console.log(document); // prints the DOM object

*/


/*
//2.The document object represents the entire HTML document as a JavaScript object. 
//You can use the document object to access and manipulate different parts of the HTML document, such as the document's title, body, and elements.

console.log(document.title); // prints the document's title
console.log(document.body); // prints the document's body element
*/



/*
//3.You can also use the document object to change the properties of HTML elements.

document.body.style.backgroundColor = "red"; // sets the background color of the body element to red
