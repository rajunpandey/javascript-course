/*
//The Window Object is a global object in the browser that represents the browser window.
// It is the top-level object in the browser's JavaScript hierarchy and everything in the browser window is a property of the Window object. 
//You can access the Window object by typing window in the browser console.

console.log(window); // prints the Window object

*/





//Since the Window object is global, you can also use it to access other global objects such as the console and the alert function.

window.console.log("Hello World!"); // same as console.log("Hello World!");
window.alert("This is an alert!"); // same as alert("This is an alert!");
