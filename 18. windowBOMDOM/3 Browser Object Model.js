//The Browser Object Model (BOM) is a programming interface for web browsers.
// It provides access to browser-specific objects such as the browser history, the location bar, and the browser window.





//The BOM is not a part of the official DOM specification and is specific to each browser.
// As a result, the objects and methods available in the BOM may vary between different browsers.
//The Window object is a part of the BOM and provides access to many of the BOM objects and methods.

console.log(window.location.href); // prints the current URL of the page
