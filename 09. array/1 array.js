// Arrays are a way to store multiple values in a single variable.

//Arrays are declared using square brackets [] and the values are separated by commas ,. For example, 

let arr = [1, 2, 3];

//The values in an array are called elements.
// The first element of an array is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on.
