//Returns the element with the specified ID attribute.
//If an element with the specified ID is not found, the method will return null.

const home = document.getElementById('home');
console.log(home); // <section id="home">...</section>


//The getElementById method is useful when we know the ID of the element we want to select. 
//In the example above, we know that the home section has an ID of home, so we can use the getElementById method to select it.
