//You can also use backticks ` (it is the button under your escape key) to create a string, called a template literal.
/*
//This is useful when you need to embed variables within a string. Without template literals, you would need to concatenate strings and variables using the + operator. Here's an example: 
const name = "Rajun";
const favorite = "pandey";
const sentence = name + " loves " + favorite;
console.log(sentence); 
*/


/*
//With template literals, you can embed variables within a string without using the + operator. We use the ${variable} syntax to embed a variable within a string. Here's an example:
const name = "Rajun";
const favorite = "pandey";
const sentence = `${name} loves ${favorite}`;
console.log(sentence);
