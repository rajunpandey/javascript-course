//A string is a collection of characters enclosed in quotes. In JavaScript, you can use either single quotes or double quotes to create a string. However, it's important to remember that once you choose a quote type to start your string,

/*
// you must use the same type to close it. For example,
let name = "Harry";         //correct
let friend = 'Prakash'      //correct
let wrong = 'Harry";        //wrong, never do this!
*/



/*
//Even a number enclosed in quotes is considered a string, like "29". You can convert a number to a string using the toString() method. For example:
let age = 29;
let ageAsString = age.toString();
console.log(typeof ageAsString); //string
