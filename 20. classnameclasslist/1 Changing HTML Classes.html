<!--
In HTML, we can use classes to group elements and apply the same styles to them using CSS. 
In JavaScript, we can manipulate classes to change the appearance or behavior of elements dynamically.
-->
<!--<Consider the following HTML:-->

<html>
<head>
    <title>Lesson 45</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="first">
        <span>Hello, this is a test text</span>
    </div>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

 <!-- and also add the following CSS:-->

html, body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

.yellow {
    background-color: yellow;
    color: white;
}

.red {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
}

.text-dark {
    color: black;
}
 <!--If we reload the web page we will see that no changes will be made because the CSS isn't added yet.
  But if we make changes in HTML to also include a CSS class we made, for example:
-->
<div id="first" class="red"> 


<!--We will see the changes getting reflected. We can also add to see multiple classes:-->

<div id="first" class="yellow text-dark">
