<!-- In the DOM tree, an element can have zero or more children.
  A child is an element that is directly inside another element.
   For example, in the following HTML code, the body element has three children: h1, p, and script.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>I am Child of body</h1>
    <p>I am also child of body and h1 is my sibling</p>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>

<!--
In the above example, the body element has three children: h1, p, and script.
The h1 and p and script elements are children of the body element.
The h1 and p and script elements are siblings because they are children of the same parent element -->





<!--

Siblings: Siblings are elements that share the same parent.
          In the given code, the <h1> and <p> elements are siblings because they share the same parent, which is the <body> element.

 Parents: The parent element of any given element is the element that contains it.
          In the given code, the parent of the <h1> and <p> elements is the <body> element. Similarly, the parent of the <body> element is the <html> element.
    
Ancestors: Ancestors are elements that are above a given element in the DOM tree hierarchy. 
          In the given code, the <html> element is the ancestor of the <body>, <h1>, and <p> elements.
    
 Descendants: Descendants are elements that are below a given element in the DOM tree hierarchy.
              In the given code, the <body>, <h1>, and <p> elements are descendants of the <html> element
