/*
//setInterval is used to execute a function repeatedly at a fixed interval. 
//The syntax for setInterval is as follows:

setInterval(function, delay);
*/

//1.The function parameter is the function that you want to execute.
//2.The delay parameter is the number of milliseconds to wait before executing the function again. 

/*
//Here's an example that demonstrates how to use setInterval:
var count = 0;
var intervalID = setInterval(function() {
  count++;
  console.log('Count: ' + count);
}, 1000);

//This code will increment the count variable every second and log the current value of count to the console.
