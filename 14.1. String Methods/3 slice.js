//The slice() method returns a section of a string. You can provide two arguments to the method: the starting index and the ending index (not inclusive) of the substring you want to extract.

let name = "rajun";
console.log(name.slice(2, 4)); 
console.log(name.slice(1, 3)); 
console.log(name.slice(2));
